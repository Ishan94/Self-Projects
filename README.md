This is the first working version of Simulated Annealing Algorithm on TSP Problem for optimisation of travelling distances

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Travelingsalesman_SimulatedAnnealing.ipynb is the driver code which implements the SA Algorithm on a set of randomly chosen X, Y Coordinates on 2D Grid
2. Hyperparameters for this include : Starting Temperature, Cooling Factor alpha, number of iterations and Grid Size
3. Algorithm starts with a Greedy initial solution
4. Weights are optimized in each iteration
